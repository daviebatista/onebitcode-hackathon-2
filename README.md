## üîç About <a name = "about-it"></a>
Welcome to X-Health! This project was made by <a href="https://github.com/daviebatista">daviebatista</a> and <a href="https://github.com/H1g0rw">H1g0rw</a> for the second edition of OneBitCode's Hackathons.

This project's goal is to build a website for a gym, based on an authoral <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/aE2ogEyrQlA97nXdtHk4Fv/XHealth?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PgAiu6PCSkGOfsuh-1">Figma</a> wireframe made by the project's team.

## üéà Features <a name = "features"></a>
The project is based on a Single-Page-Application/SPA for the gym's services. It uses Angular-Router for better performance and usage of the website's potential.

- Page transitions: The application contains transitions between the routes, in a way of turning its usage smoothier;
- Register and Login: The sign section contains a button that changes between login and register forms. Both of them are 100% functional, with verifications for the inputs and its values;
- Responsivity: The project has responsive design on the entire application. Its elements have a progressive pattern to the different breakpoints;
- Routing: The application uses Angular Router for its alternate pages.
